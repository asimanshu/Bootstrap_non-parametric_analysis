The repository contains R source file for non-parametric data analysis with bootstrap technique. This project is under progress and aimed to develop and popularize the application of bootstrap for non-parametric analysis. Bootstrap is used when the data is inconsistent and non-uniform. Bootstrap is a robust technique or approach when the data is asymetrical. It assigns an emirical value randomly to each data point. It's a process of jackknifing in statistics (catch and release). In near future, it is aimed to provide more elaboration on this technique with statistical approach. Since it is an ongoing project and the data is product of an original work, it is not publicly shared at this moment. However, in future, it will be shared with complete work and the power of bootstrap will be revealed.
